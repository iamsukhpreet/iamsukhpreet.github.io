## What is Post-Festival Depression (PFD)?

Post-festival depression, also known as post-holiday blues, is a common emotional experience many people feel after the holiday season or big celebrations. After Diwali, it’s natural to feel a sense of sadness, emptiness, or even a lack of motivation. This dip often follows events that are highly anticipated, joyful, or emotionally intense.

### Why Does PFD Happen?

The emotional emptiness after a big celebration like Diwali can happen for a few key reasons. Let’s explore these in detail:

---

### 1. **Emotional Highs and Lows**

Diwali brings vibrant joy and excitement, with bright lights, fireworks, and family gatherings that create a “high” in mood. The contrast between the festival’s excitement and the calm that follows can feel stark, leading to a sense of letdown.

**Example:** After days of festivities, from lighting diyas and decorating the house to enjoying sweets with loved ones, returning to regular life can feel surprisingly dull.

---

### 2. **End of Anticipation**

In the weeks leading up to Diwali, there’s a lot to look forward to—shopping, planning family gatherings, decorating, and more. When Diwali ends, this anticipation can quickly vanish, leaving an emotional void.

**Example:** The excitement of shopping for Diwali outfits and preparing gifts for family and friends creates a joyful buildup. Once the celebration ends, however, it’s common to feel like there’s suddenly “nothing to look forward to.”

---

### 3. **Physical Exhaustion**

The busy schedule surrounding Diwali celebrations, from cleaning and decorating to hosting, can be physically exhausting. When the festivities wind down, the body often feels drained and tired.

**Example:** After days of preparation, late-night celebrations, and welcoming guests, the physical toll catches up, making you feel worn out as you settle back into everyday routines.

---

### 4. **Return to Routine and Responsibilities**

Diwali provides a break from daily routines and responsibilities, allowing people to spend time with family and relax. Once it’s over, getting back to regular chores, work, and responsibilities can feel tough and uninspiring.

**Example:** Returning to work after Diwali can feel overwhelming, especially if you’ve taken time off. The festive break can make it challenging to jump back into regular routines.

---

### 5. **Social Withdrawal**

Diwali often brings people together in celebration, with family gatherings, parties, and community events. Once the festival is over, the sudden reduction in social interaction can lead to feelings of isolation or loneliness.

**Example:** After the joyful gatherings with extended family and friends, returning to a quieter home can feel like a sudden emotional drop, especially if you don’t have similar events in the near future.

### Coping with Post-Festival Depression

Understanding that these feelings are a natural part of the post-festival phase can help in managing them. Here are some strategies to ease post-Diwali blues:

- Plan small activities to look forward to, like a coffee meet-up with a friend or a family dinner.
- Take time to rest and recharge; your body and mind need time to recover.
- Practice gratitude by reflecting on happy memories from Diwali.
- Ease back into routines gradually to help with the transition.
- Stay away from social media.
- Reprioritize your goal post festivals and be engaged in productive work.
- Sanitise yourself by taking homemade meals and avoid excessive sugar intake.
- Start your day with work motivational thoughts.

Remember, post-festival depression is temporary, and with time and self-care, you’ll soon feel re-energized.
