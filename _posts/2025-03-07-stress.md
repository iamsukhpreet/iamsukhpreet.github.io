## Stress  

- Stress is a multi-faceted process.  
- It involves the evaluation of a situation and the response given to it.  
- Normally, it is believed that stress arises due to negative events or stressful circumstances. However, in reality, it can also result from positive events.  

### Example:  

Winning a competition, getting a promotion, or receiving a reward can also cause stress. That is, even positive events can lead to stress.  

### Hans Selyeâ€™s Stress Theory  

Physiologist **Hans Selye** categorized stress into two types:  

1. **Positive Stress (Eustress)**  
2. **Negative Stress (Distress)**  

### Definition of Stress  

- Stress is a multi-faceted process.  
- Stressful events or situations generate tension (mental strain).  
- It depends on whether the situation is within a personâ€™s control. If a person cannot control a situation, stress is generated.  
- Stress can be **psychological** or **physiological**.  
- Due to stress, a person may experience **mental** and **physical disturbances**.  
- Stress is neither always harmful nor always beneficial. It depends on the surrounding circumstances.  

It is believed that stress is an **assessment** of a situation or event and the response given to it. It depends on a personâ€™s **mental and physical capacity**.

#### 2. Anger and Aggression  

When an individual experiences **obstruction in achieving a goal**, frustration occurs, leading to aggressive behavior.
